# TinyApp Project
This TinyApp project was build using Node. The app will allow users to shorten long URLs much like TinyURL.com and bit.ly do.

TinyApp is a URL shortening service and a link management platform. This app allows to customize links and make them a little bit shorter regardless of what address they ultimately go to.
